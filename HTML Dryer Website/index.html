    <p>The proper conservation of corn, grain, oilseeds and rice safe-
        guards their quality and their value for the producer. Together
        with cleaning and the storage method, drying plays a key role
        as well. Only if the moisture has been removed the raw
        products can be stored for a longer time and losses are
        avoided.</p>
